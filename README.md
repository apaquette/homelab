# Homelab Infrastructure

Declarative infrastructure for a self-hosted homelab, built around NixOS, systemd, Caddy, PostgreSQL, sops-nix, and Restic.

The project treats the server as infrastructure-as-code: system configuration, service definitions, networking, secrets integration, monitoring, and backup policy are maintained in Git and reproduced through NixOS configuration.

## Technical Highlights

This project focuses on infrastructure engineering rather than simply hosting applications.

* **Declarative infrastructure** — The complete host configuration is defined in NixOS modules and managed through a flake, making system state reproducible, reviewable, and version-controlled.
* **Service orchestration with systemd** — Application lifecycle, ordering, dependencies, scheduled jobs, persistent mounts, and failure handling are expressed through native systemd units rather than ad-hoc shell orchestration.
* **Database-aware backups** — Stateful applications such as Nextcloud and Immich use PostgreSQL custom-format dumps captured alongside their persistent application data, providing a consistent recovery boundary.
* **Automated backup lifecycle** — Restic backups are scheduled and ordered declaratively, with service quiescing, cleanup, retention, pruning, repository integrity checks, and failure notifications handled automatically.
* **Restore validation** — Backups are validated from real Restic snapshots, including database structure checks and byte-level filesystem restoration tests, rather than treating a successful backup command as proof of recoverability.
* **Encrypted secret management** — sops-nix keeps credentials and API tokens encrypted in Git while exposing them to services only through controlled runtime secret files and generated environment configuration.
* **Layered monitoring** — Beszel, Uptime Kuma, custom storage-health checks, and failure notifications provide complementary views of host health, service availability, filesystem capacity, and operational failures.
* **Internal and external service isolation** — Caddy provides reverse-proxy and TLS termination, with separate public and LAN-only service exposure and dnsmasq providing local service discovery.
* **Infrastructure testing** — Declarative assertions and NixOS VM tests verify service configuration, dependencies, storage, networking, secrets, monitoring, and backup invariants before production activation.
* **Explicit state boundaries** — Declarative configuration is kept separate from mutable application state, allowing services to be rebuilt or reconfigured without treating persistent data as disposable.


## Highlights

* **NixOS 26.05** for declarative system and service management
* **Nix flakes** for reproducible configuration and pinned dependencies
* **systemd** for service lifecycle, scheduling, dependencies, and failure handling
* **Caddy** for public reverse proxying and internal TLS
* **dnsmasq** for LAN DNS and DHCP
* **PostgreSQL 17** for stateful applications
* **sops-nix** for encrypted secrets and runtime secret deployment
* **Restic** for application backups, retention, pruning, and integrity checks
* **Declarative monitoring** for storage, services, and system health
* **Automated configuration tests** plus NixOS VM validation

Application services are managed as native NixOS services where practical. Persistent application state remains separate from the declarative configuration so that service upgrades and configuration rebuilds do not implicitly replace application data.

```

The configuration is organized around composable NixOS modules rather than a single monolithic host definition.

## Secrets

Secrets are stored in an encrypted SOPS file and rendered into the system at activation/runtime as required by individual services.

The repository contains encrypted secret material, not plaintext credentials.

Applications consume secrets through declarative NixOS configuration rather than checked-in `.env` files.

## Backup design

Application backups are implemented as declarative systemd + Restic jobs.

The backup system provides:

* application-specific backup scopes
* PostgreSQL dumps for database-backed applications
* consistent filesystem snapshots
* service stop/start handling where required
* sequential backup ordering
* retention and pruning
* repository integrity checks
* failure notifications through ntfy

The Restic repository is stored on dedicated backup storage rather than the primary application volume.

Detailed procedures and backup scopes are documented in [`docs/backup-and-restore.md`](docs/backup-and-restore.md).

## Validation

Configuration changes are validated before activation:

```bash
nix flake check
sudo nixos-rebuild build --flake ~/Projects/homelab#homelab
```

The project contains declarative configuration assertions and NixOS VM tests for important invariants such as:

* enabled services
* service dependencies
* storage configuration
* DNS configuration
* secret wiring
* backup configuration
* monitoring
* removal of obsolete service definitions

The production configuration is then activated with:

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ~/Projects/homelab#homelab
```

## Design principles

### Declarative infrastructure

Configuration belongs in Git wherever practical. The desired server state should be represented by Nix rather than by undocumented manual changes.

### Explicit dependencies

Systemd dependencies, persistent storage requirements, service ordering, backup ordering, and secret relationships are declared rather than inferred from startup timing.

### Recoverability

Backups are treated as an operational feature rather than an afterthought. Database dumps and application state are captured together where consistency requires it, and restore paths are tested against real Restic snapshots.

### Minimal privilege

Services use dedicated users where supported by their NixOS modules, while secrets and administrative operations remain restricted to the system components that require them.

### Test before activation

Configuration changes are validated with the Nix test suite and a build before being activated on the host.
